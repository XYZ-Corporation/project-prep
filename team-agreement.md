# Group Project: Team Agreement


**-Cooperation Plan**

-What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

Dajon - CSS, HTML

Malik - JS, pair programming in CSS

Ryan - HTML, pair programming, JS

Laurence - strong teamplayer, HTML

Slava - GIT, JS, organizational skills


-How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?





**-Conflict Plan**


What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

-- majority vote, if needed

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

-- update everyone, make sure that person teaches everyone what’s going on. (what the person is doing could be best for the group, perhaps nobody could figure out how to do an algorithm and that algorithm is made out of a huge complex set of codes)

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
-- we will have open communication, people volunteer and other people may ask for help or ask to switch assignments if they’re not confident.
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

-- Request TA help and share what they learned from that interaction.
-- that member may not have adequate skills yet, so we’ll have that person assigned with someone who can train as they work… perhaps in css. later on, that person can take over for more customizations.
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
